A CLI Tool to help you as a new (or old) qte:ie to setup your machine with the necessary programs that we most commonly use!🚀

## Installation

To install the CLI Tool on your machine follow these steps:

If you don't have git installed Download the [.zip file](https://github.com/qteab/qte-cli/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

Open the .zip file and save the files in a directory of your choosing and enter the folder in the terminal.

```bash
  cd path/to/qte.sh
```

Make it executable permissions using 

```bash
  chmod +x qte.sh
```

Then, create a symlink to the script using

```bash
  sudo ln -s $(pwd)/qte.sh /usr/local/bin/qte
```


You can now run the qte command in the terminal 🥳
